    The tardigrade(also called the waterbear) is a wonderful animal that if disturbed or is put in a <strong>harmful</strong> place will go dormantand live like that for up to ten years.<br>
  They look like bears with flakes as skin. They live in mossy areas, dunes, coasts, and other places like them.
