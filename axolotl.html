  Axolotls for beginers.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Axolotls are salamanders. Unlike most salamanders they stay in their adolescent stage where they have external gills but also have lungs.
    They also have the amazing ability to regenerate any body part (including the brain, heart and everything else) that may get damaged or removed.

  Axolotls for pets
  </h3>
  <p>
    Axolotls make great pets. As a baby they cost from $20-$40 and as an adult they cost around $90-$150. 
    They are easy to take care of and if you forget to feed once or twice its fine. You only have to clean their tank once or twice a month.
    Those are reasons you should get an axolotl over a fish or a lizard.
